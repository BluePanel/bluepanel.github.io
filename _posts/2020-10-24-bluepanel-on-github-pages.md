We are happy to announce that we have recently moved our website to GitHub
Pages.

Therefore we replaced our custom Ruby on Rails (RoR) website with this new
site which is created via the static site generator Jekyll.
Switching to Jekyll helps us to reduce development time for this website
and enables us to spend more time on real content creation.

We hope you are enjoying our new page! :-)

Stay healthy,
your **BluePanel-Dev Team**
